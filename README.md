Setting up a VPN involves creating a secure tunnel between your home and office networks, allowing communication between them. Here, I'll provide a basic guide on setting up a simple VPN using OpenVPN. Note that this is just one approach, and there are various VPN solutions available.

### Prerequisites:

1. **Office Network:**
   - Have a server in your office network that will act as the VPN server.

2. **Home Node:**
   - Ensure your home node has OpenVPN installed.

### Steps:

#### 1. Install OpenVPN on Office Server:

On the server in your office network, install OpenVPN. The commands might vary based on your operating system:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

#### 2. Set Up OpenVPN Configuration on Office Server:

Create an OpenVPN server configuration file, e.g., `/etc/openvpn/server.conf`. Below is a minimal example. Adjust as needed:

```conf
# server.conf

port 1194
proto udp
dev tun
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt
push "route 192.168.138.0 255.255.255.0" # Adjust this to your office network
keepalive 10 120
key-direction 0
tls-auth ta.key 0
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
user nobody
group nogroup
persist-key
persist-tun
status openvpn-status.log
log-append  openvpn.log
verb 3
```

#### 3. Generate Necessary Keys and Certificates:

Run the following commands on the office server:

```bash
cd /etc/openvpn
openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
openvpn --genkey --secret ca.key
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in ca.csr -out ca.crt -signkey ca.key
openvpn --genkey --secret server.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -out server.crt -signkey server.key
```

#### 4. Start OpenVPN on Office Server:

Start the OpenVPN service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server
```

#### 5. Install OpenVPN on Home Node:

Install OpenVPN on your home node. Adjust the commands based on your operating system:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvpn
```

#### 6. Copy Client Configuration from Office to Home Node:

Copy the following files from your office server to your home node:

- `/etc/openvpn/ca.crt`
- `/etc/openvpn/ta.key`
- `/etc/openvpn/client.conf`

#### 7. Create Client Configuration on Home Node:

Create a client configuration file, e.g., `/etc/openvpn/client.conf` on your home node:

```conf
# client.conf

client
dev tun
proto udp
remote <office-server-ip> 1194 # Replace with your office server's IP
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
ca ca.crt
tls-auth ta.key 1
cipher AES-256-CBC
auth SHA256
key-direction 1
comp-lzo
verb 3
```

#### 8. Start OpenVPN on Home Node:

Start the OpenVPN service on your home node:

```bash
sudo openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/client.conf
```

#### 9. Test the VPN Connection:

Verify that the VPN connection is established:

```bash
ping 10.8.0.1 # Replace with your office server's VPN IP
```

#### 10. Update Kubernetes Configuration:

On your home node, update the `kubeadm join` command to use the VPN IP of the office server instead of the public IP:

```bash
sudo kubeadm join 10.8.0.1:6443 --token <new-token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<new-hash>
```

Replace `<new-token>` and `<new-hash>` with the updated values obtained in step 7.

Now, your home node should be able to connect to the Kubernetes cluster securely through the VPN. Adjust the configurations based on your specific setup and security requirements.
